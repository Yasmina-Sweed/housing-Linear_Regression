# Housing Price Prediction (EDA + Preprocessing + Linear Regression)

This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling of Housing prices using the ** Housing Dataset**. 

## Overview

This project aims to predict the housing prices in California based on factors like median income, housing age, rooms, bedrooms, and other demographic features. The analysis steps include:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.
- **Data Preprocessing** to handle missing values, scale the features, and encode categorical variables.
- **Linear Regression** to build a predictive model for housing prices.
